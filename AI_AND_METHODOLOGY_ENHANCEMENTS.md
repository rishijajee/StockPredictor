## 🤖 AI Integration: FinBERT Financial Sentiment Analysis

### What Was Added

**FinBERT** is now integrated as an optional AI-powered sentiment analysis layer:

- **Model**: ProsusAI/finbert (Hugging Face)
- **Training**: Pre-trained on 1.8 million financial news articles, earnings calls, and market commentary
- **Accuracy**: ~97% on financial sentiment classification tasks
- **Output**: Sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral) with confidence scores

### How It Works

```
Stock Analysis → FinBERT API → Sentiment Classification →
Combined with Quantitative Scores → Comprehensive AI Summary
```

1. Stock context is sent to Hugging Face's FinBERT API
2. Model analyzes and returns sentiment probabilities
3. AI sentiment is merged with technical/fundamental scores
4. Natural language summary generated combining all factors

### Implementation Details

**File**: `analysis_engine.py`

**Key Functions**:
- `get_financial_sentiment()` - Calls Hugging Face FinBERT API
- `generate_llm_analysis()` - Combines FinBERT sentiment with quantitative analysis

**Features**:
- ✅ Graceful fallback if API unavailable
- ✅ Environment variable configuration (HF_API_KEY)
- ✅ Works perfectly without API key (rule-based mode)
- ✅ No user-facing errors if FinBERT unavailable

### Setup (Optional)

FinBERT is **completely optional**. The system works perfectly without it.

To enable FinBERT:
1. Get free API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Set environment variable: `HF_API_KEY=your_token`
3. Deploy/restart application

See `FINBERT_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### Benefits

| Without FinBERT | With FinBERT |
|----------------|--------------|
| Rule-based quantitative analysis | AI-enhanced sentiment analysis |
| Technical + Fundamental scoring | Technical + Fundamental + AI sentiment |
| Works immediately (no setup) | Requires free API key |
| Free forever | Free with Hugging Face account |

## 📚 Enhanced Methodology Documentation

### What Was Added

Comprehensive "what" and "how" explanations for every analysis component:

### 1. **Technical Analysis** (30 points)
- **What**: Studies historical price/volume data to forecast future movements
- **How**: Calculates 6 indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volume)
- **Details**: Each indicator explained with:
  - Mathematical formula
  - Scoring criteria
  - Interpretation guidelines
  - Market benchmarks

**Example Enhancement**:
```
Before: "RSI measures momentum"
After: "RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Momentum oscillator measuring speed
       and magnitude of price changes on 0-100 scale. Calculated using 14-period
       average gains vs losses. RSI 30-70 adds +5 points (healthy), RSI < 30
       adds +3 points (oversold bounce potential), RSI > 70 subtracts 3 points
       (overbought risk)"
```

### 2. **Fundamental Analysis** (20 points)
- **What**: Examines financial statements to determine intrinsic value
- **How**: Analyzes P/E ratio, profit margins, ROE against industry benchmarks
- **Details**: Industry-specific benchmarks added:
  - Software: 20-30% margins
  - Retail: 2-5% margins
  - Banks: 20-25% margins

### 3. **AI-Powered Financial Sentiment**
- **What**: FinBERT NLP model trained on financial text
- **How**: API calls to Hugging Face, combines with quantitative scores
- **Details**:
  - Model accuracy (97%)
  - Sentiment categories explained
  - Fallback behavior documented

### 4. **Sector & Industry Analysis**
- **What**: Sector rotation analysis using 11 SPDR sector ETFs
- **How**: 3-month performance tracking, classification into outperform/inline/underperform
- **Details**:
  - All 11 sectors listed with descriptions
  - Economic cycle positioning
  - Impact on individual stock recommendations

### 5. **Market Sentiment Analysis**
- **What**: Overall market "mood" via S&P 500 performance
- **How**: 1-month SPY performance calculated and categorized
- **Details**:
  - Bullish/Neutral/Bearish thresholds
  - Impact on different stock types
  - Risk-on vs risk-off behavior

### 6. **Interest Rate Analysis**
- **What**: Impact of borrowing costs on equity valuations
- **How**: 10-Year Treasury yield tracking with trend analysis
- **Details**:
  - High rates (>4.5%): Negative for growth, positive for financials
  - Low rates (<3.5%): Positive for growth, negative for banks
  - Valuation formula: Stock Price = Future Cash Flows ÷ (1 + rate)^years

### 7. **Economic Indicators**
- **What**: Macro statistics (inflation, GDP, unemployment)
- **How**: Qualitative assessment based on Fed data and trends
- **Details**:
  - CPI/PPI impact chains explained
  - GDP growth sweet spots (2-3%)
  - Investment implications for each scenario

### 8. **Geopolitical Analysis**
- **What**: Political events and international relations impact
- **How**: Multi-dimensional risk assessment (trade, conflicts, policy, stability)
- **Details**:
  - Factor-by-factor breakdown
  - Sector-specific impacts
