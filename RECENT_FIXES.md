# Recent Fixes Applied to StockPredictor

## Date: October 30, 2025

###  1. Pre-Market and Post-Market Handling Fixed

**Problem**: The application was not properly handling pre-market and post-market hours, causing issues with stock price display and search functionality.

**Solution implemented in** `prediction_engine.py:199-242`:

- Added comprehensive market hours detection including:
  - **Pre-market hours**: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET
  - **Regular market hours**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
  - **Post-market hours**: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET
  - **After hours**: 8:00 PM - 4:00 AM ET
  - **Weekend detection**

- Price labels now accurately reflect the trading session:
  - `"Current Price"` - During regular market hours with same-day data
  - `"Previous Close Price (Pre-Market)"` - During pre-market hours
  - `"Previous Close Price (Post-Market)"` - During post-market hours
  - `"Previous Close Price"` - After hours trading
  - `"Last Close Price (Weekend)"` - During weekends

**Technical Details**:
- Uses `pytz` library for accurate timezone handling (America/New_York)
- Handles both timezone-aware and naive timestamps from yfinance
- Uses the closing price from the previous trading day during pre/post-market hours
- Gracefully falls back to "Last Close Price" on any timezone errors

**Why this matters**:
- Users can now search and analyze stocks at any time of day
- Price labels clearly indicate whether the price is live or from previous close
- No more confusion about stale price data during off-market hours

### 2. Detailed Analysis Methodology Descriptions Added

**Problem**: The methodology endpoint provided only brief descriptions, lacking the detail users need to understand how the analysis works.

**Solution implemented in** `app.py:70-236`:

#### **Technical Analysis** (Lines 78-91)
Now includes:
- Detailed explanation of each indicator (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volume)

- Data source information

#### **Fundamental Analysis** (Lines 93-105)
Now includes:
- Detailed metrics breakdown (P/E ratio, Profit Margins, ROE)
- Specific scoring rules (e.g., P/E 10-25 = +10 points)

## Testing Status

The fixes have been applied and are ready for testing. To verify:

1. **Test Pre-Market** (4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET):
   - Search for any stock ticker
   - Verify price label shows "Previous Close Price (Pre-Market)"
   - Confirm analysis runs successfully

2. **Test Post-Market** (4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET):
   - Search for any stock ticker
   - Verify price label shows "Previous Close Price (Post-Market)"
   - Confirm analysis runs successfully

3. **Test Methodology Endpoint**:
   - Access `/api/methodology`
   - Verify detailed descriptions appear for all components
   - Confirm new sections (Prediction Algorithms, Scoring System, Data Sources) are present

## Files Modified

1. **prediction_engine.py** (Lines 195-242)
   - Enhanced market hours detection logic
   - Added pre-market and post-market handling
   - Improved price label accuracy

2. **app.py** (Lines 70-236)
   - Expanded methodology endpoint
   - Added detailed descriptions for all analysis components
   - Added new informational sections
