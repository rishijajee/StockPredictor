## üí∞ Understanding Railway Pricing

### **Free Trial Credit: $5**
When you sign up, you get **$5 in free credit** (no credit card required).

**What $5 Gets You:**
- **~1000 hours** of compute time (if app uses 5 MB RAM average)
- Enough for **1-2 months** of development + testing
- Or **several days** of production traffic

### **Usage Calculation:**
Railway charges based on **resource usage**:
- **Formula:** `Cost = RAM (GB) √ó Hours √ó $0.000463`

**Example for StockPredictor:**
- Average RAM usage: ~200 MB (0.2 GB)
- Running 24/7 for 1 month: 720 hours
- **Cost:** `0.2 GB √ó 720 hours √ó $0.000463 = ~$0.67/month`

**Your $5 credit lasts ~7.5 months at this rate!**

### **After Free Credit Runs Out:**
- Add a credit card to continue (pay-as-you-go)
- Railway charges only for what you use
- Typical cost: **$1-3/month** for light traffic
- **$5-10/month** for moderate production traffic

### **Monitor Usage:**
- Dashboard shows real-time usage
- Set up billing alerts
- Can add more credit anytime

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### **Issue 1: Build Fails**

**Error:** `ERROR: Could not install packages...`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test dependencies locally first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If successful locally but fails on Railway:
# - Check Python version matches runtime.txt
# - Verify all packages are available on PyPI
```

### **Issue 2: Application Crashes on Startup**

**Error:** `Application failed to respond`

**Solution:**
1. Check **Logs** tab for Python errors
2. Common causes:
   - Missing environment variables (add HF_API_KEY)
   - Import errors (check requirements.txt)
   - Port binding issues (Railway uses PORT env var)

**Fix port binding in app.py:**
```python
# Add this to end of app.py if not present:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

### **Issue 3: 502 Bad Gateway**

**Causes:**
- App is still starting up (wait 30 seconds)
- App crashed during request
- Out of memory

**Solution:**
1. Check logs for crash messages
2. Look for memory errors
3. Test locally to reproduce error

### **Issue 4: Slow API Responses**

**Cause:** Free tier has limited resources

**Solution:**
- Expected for `/api/top-stocks` (analyzes 100+ stocks)
- Consider caching results
- Or upgrade Railway plan for more resources

### **Issue 5: "Out of Credit" Error**

**Cause:** Used up $5 free credit

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Account** ‚Üí **Billing**
2. Add credit card
3. Add $5-10 credit
4. Set up billing alerts

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### **1. Rotate API Keys:**

Your HF_API_KEY is currently in .env file. For production:

1. Generate new key at: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Update in Railway Variables tab
3. Delete old key from Hugging Face

### **2. Use Railway's Secret Management:**

- ‚úÖ Environment variables are encrypted
- ‚úÖ Not visible in logs
- ‚úÖ Not exposed in client-side code

### **3. Enable HTTPS (Free):**

Railway provides SSL certificates automatically ‚úì

### **4. Set Up Access Logs:**

Monitor who's accessing your app:
- Check Metrics tab regularly
- Set up alerts for unusual traffic
- Use Railway's built-in analytics

## üìà Scaling Your Application

### **When You Need More Resources:**

**Signs you need to scale:**
- Slow response times (>5 seconds)
- Memory errors in logs
- High CPU usage (>80% sustained)
- Increased traffic (>1000 requests/day)

**Scaling Options:**

1. **Vertical Scaling (More Resources):**
   - Railway automatically allocates resources
   - Pay based on actual usage
   - No configuration needed

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Multiple Instances):**
   - Railway Pro plan allows multiple replicas
   - Load balancing handled automatically
   - Cost: $20/month + usage

3. **Add Caching Layer:**
   - Deploy Redis on Railway
   - Cache stock analysis results
   - Significantly faster repeated queries
